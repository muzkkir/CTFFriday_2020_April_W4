# Writeup for CTFFriday 2020 April Week 4 by Muzkkir



In this article, I’m going to explain solutions of NSCTF April Week 4, 2020 CTF challenge named "Marvel Vs. DC Movies" Organized by Net-Square Solutions Pvt. Ltd. and created by Aman Barot. Both Marvel and DC are preparing to enter new eras in their respective universes, and even though they have been competing against each other for years. However, This for CTF does not require any knowledge about movies. 


This CTF had four different challenges in which major 3 domain was covered; Web, Network, and Cryptography challenge. We have to start from Website exploitation to access the system and decrypt the flag file.

## First Flag


<kbd>![alt text](test/36.png)</kbd>


As the challenge was about the findings of the "Robots.txt" file. I tried to check the request and response for the "http://10.90.137.137/robots.txt" page. But, It gives an empty response. :sweat_smile:


<kbd>![alt text](test/3.png)</kbd>


I changed the request method to POST, still, that did not work. I thought it might be blocked by user-agent. So, I visited the "https://user-agents.net/" page and took a random browser-agent, and build the bash script to try all one by one.


<kbd>![alt text](test/33.png)</kbd>


<kbd>![alt text](test/4.png)</kbd>


But I didn’t get any result :persevere: because it seems that I have to use a customs agent. I visit the home page for the hint. On source code 2 "base64" value was written in hidden. After decoding to those values :wink:  


<kbd>![alt text](test/5.png)</kbd>


```
Encode Value   :  "dXNlX2NoYW5kcmFtYXVsaV8="

Decoded Value  :  "use_chandramauli_"

Encode Value   :  "d2hlbmV2ZXJfeW91X3dhbnQh"

Decoded Value:  "whenever_you_want"
```


Now, It's Show Time:


> curl --user-agent "chandramauli" http://10.90.137.137/robots.txt


and received a response:


> "You made it ... but I want major version 2."


<kbd>![alt text](test/6.png)</kbd>



Spending a few minutes with the "try and error" method to get the flag.



<kbd>![alt text](test/7.png)</kbd>



Finally, That was my 1st Flag !!!



```flag{tH!5_!5_N0_Pl@C3_t0_D!3}```


<kbd>![alt text](test/8.png)</kbd>






## Second Flag



2nd Challange was about to find the host vulnerability. I start the Nmap scan on the machine. I got 2 more ports that were open. "FTP" and "SSH"


<kbd>![alt text](test/9.png)</kbd>


I tried anonymously login on SSH Port!


<kbd>![alt text](test/10.png)</kbd>


I also tried the FTP login. For that, the first thing I search for "https://www.smartfile.com/blog/the-ultimate-ftp-commands-list/" :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: But still I did not get any useful information.


<kbd>![alt text](test/11.png)</kbd>


So I return to the "/robots.txt" page for the hint and got it.


<kbd>![alt text](test/12.png)</kbd>


A few minutes later, I visited "view-source:http://10.90.137.137/Lockdown_is_the_Key/" and saw some awkward URL path reference.


> Then I realize that similar tasks I played on "HackTheBox" where I used SQLi for the flag. I tried SQL Injection, but somehow it did not work.


<kbd>![alt text](test/13.png)</kbd>



I have also looked for other vulnerabilities and within a few minutes I found "File Retrieval".



<kbd>![alt text](test/14.png)</kbd>


I searched for sensitive system files and directories like passwd and shadow files, home user's directory files, bash history files, etc. But, not anything was much useful. Then, I retrieved the FTP configuration file and got my 2nd flag.



```"flag{W3_@R3_!n_+H3_3NDG@M3_n0W!}"```


<kbd>![alt text](test/15.png)</kbd>




## Third Flag



After reading the entire configuration file, I found "write_enable=YES" was enabled for anonymous users. So It's time to upload the shell and get RCE. 


<kbd>![alt text](test/16.png)</kbd>


The website was written in PHP. So, I could add and run the PHP shell smoothly. One liner famous PHP shell code ```"<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>"``` I used to exploit the system. I uploaded a shell file on the server that way I can able to run system commands.


```

```

> Bingoo !!!

> Got shell !!

I looked at system information and user permission. I see 2 different files which might be key !!

<kbd>![alt text](test/19.png)</kbd>


```
So, I tried ssh login
    ssh usernsctf@10.90.137.137
    password: passiron3000
but failed. !!

Then I tried again with below credentials
    ssh nsctf@10.90.137.137
    password: iron3000
And Succeed!
```

<kbd>![alt text](test/20.png)

After running common system commands I got Flag!!!


```nsctf{"Ev3ryth!ng_!5_!N_my_m!nd"}```

<kbd>![alt text](test/21.png)</kbd>





## Fourth Flag


I saw 2 files in which one was encrypted, Then I tried to look for a decryption key in another file. That the challenge was about to solve the encryption and get the flag by decrypting the flag file. 


<kbd>![alt text](test/22.png)</kbd>


```

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 3) {
         printf("USAGE: %s INPUT OUTPUT\n", argv[0]);
         return 0;
    }
    FILE* input  = fopen(argv[1], "rb");
    FILE* output = fopen(argv[2], "wb");
    if (!input || !output) {
        printf("Error\n");
        return 0;
    }

    char c, p, t = 0;
    int i = 0;
    char k[] = "Whenever_you_Want!";
    i = 0;
    c, p, t = 0;
    int g = 0;

    while ((p = fgetc(input)) != 1) {
        c = (p - (k[i % strlen(k)] ^ t) - i*i) & 0xff;
        printf("Decrypting %x i=%d t=%d k=%d -> %d\n",p,i,t,(k[i % strlen(k)] ^ t),c);
        t = c;
        i++;
        fputc(c, output);
        g++;
        if (g>100) {break;}
    }
    return 0;
}

```

I am not "C language Master" but what I can understand from this code was that,


This code will help me to decrypt this "msg.enc" file, So I tried to run the C file but first I have to install GCC in that machine. :sweat_smile: It seems I am the first one to solve this puzzle. I need to install all dependencies to get the flag.


<kbd>![alt text](test/25.png)</kbd>


```
Now,

gcc encryptor.c -o enc

./enc msg.enc flag.txt
```

<kbd>![alt text](test/26.png)</kbd>


Still, the flag was encrypted !!!


<kbd>![alt text](test/27.png)</kbd>


Now, I needed to read each line and understand the flow of decryption. So I concluded after spending few minutes on the code, I found that the "c" parameter having the wrong "-" sign instead It needs to be "+" for adding the decryption key to the decryption logic.



```
After some changes in the file with parameter value I found that something was wrong in that line:
"c = (p - (k[i % strlen(k)] ^ t) - i*i) & 0xff;"

So I changed the "-" value to "+" So the code would work perfectly.
c = (p + (k[i % strlen(k)] ^ t) + i*i) & 0xff;
```


<kbd>![alt text](test/28.png)</kbd>


Still somewhere I did something wrong!!


A few minutes spending on reading the other flags hint !!! and suddenly I remembered the key "use_chandramauli_whenever_you_want" and I changed the decryption key from "whenever_you_want!" to "chandramauli".


<kbd>![alt text](test/29.png)</kbd>


I recompiled and run code & Gotcha !!!


```nsctf "!n_m3m0ry_0f_+0ny_5+@rK"```

<kbd>![alt text](test/30.png)</kbd>




## Conclusion


Overall, this CTF was unique for me because I learned about finding and solving the decryption logic from code. Also, playing this was fun with brainstorming and I appreciate the efforts of the team. Thank you for reading. :blush:
